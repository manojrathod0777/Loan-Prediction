# Loan Prediction Project

## Overview
The Loan Prediction Project is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict the likelihood of a loan application being approved. The project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. This solution can assist financial institutions in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes key patterns and trends in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selects and transforms significant features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Training**: Implements various machine learning algorithms to predict loan status.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model accuracy and reliability using evaluation metrics.
- **Deployment**: Interactive app built using Streamlit for real-time loan predictions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd loan-prediction-project
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset.
2. Perform data preprocessing and feature selection.
3. Train machine learning models.
4. Evaluate the performance of different models.
5. Use the Streamlit app for predictions by providing input parameters.
